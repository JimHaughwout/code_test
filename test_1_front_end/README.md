# Front End Code Test

#### Background
Part of making data useful is making it very easy to understand. 
To do this, use libraries like J


#### Basics
Start with data set. Build HTML5 visualization with libraries of your choice
# Google Map showing the location of each sensor point. Connect all the points in a line.
# Normal line chart below this:
  - X-axis is Date-Time of the sensor read
  - Y-axis is cumulative distance travelled 
# Table of facts below that using following columns:
  - foo
  - bar

#### Bonus points
* Add some tool tips (to see all the data associated with any point)
* Link the visualization (i.e., I click on a map point and see highlights and tool tips on line chart and table)
* Use jQuery Data Tables to make the table sortable and filterable 


#### Really Impress
* Build this in a small web app (e.g., Bootstrap)
* Make this responsive (smartphone, tablet and desktop breakpoints)
* Look around at other interesting visualizations. Come up with a better way to show this data
